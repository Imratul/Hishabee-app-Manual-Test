# Hishabee-app-Manual-Test
This repository showcases my manual testing efforts for the Hishabee app. The focus of the testing includes features like the product list and online shopping experience.

# Tested
1. Product List: Ensures the app correctly displays products and allows users to interact with the list.
2. Online Shop: Validates the process of browsing products, managing the shopping cart, and completing the checkout.

# Testing Approach
In this project, I applied manual testing to ensure the following:

1. Functional Testing: Verifying that each feature performs as expected.
2. Usability Testing: Ensuring the app is user-friendly and intuitive.
3. Regression Testing: Checking that new updates donâ€™t introduce any issues into existing functionality.

# Prerequisites

1. Access to the Hishabee app.
